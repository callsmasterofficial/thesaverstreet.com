              while youâ€™re shopping, it increases the number of Deal2Coupon
              coins on your dashboard. You can keep an eye on how many coins you
              have earned on your dashboard and redeem them however you like
              later. Therefore, keep in mind that the bigger the store, the
              bigger the deal and the bigger the number of Deal2Coupon coins.
